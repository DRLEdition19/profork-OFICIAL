<br>
<b>My Continued Repo of uureel's discontinued b.pro</b><br>

<b>This repo is mainly for personal use and anyone who wants to use it.</b><br>

<br>However, it is AS-IS--No support is  provided. <br>
Note: the main distro developers will not support these apps nor any system these apps are installed on if discovered.


<b><i>Credits and thanks to uureel, kron4ek, and other contributors.</i></b><br>

<b> APP INSTALL MENU  = curl -L bit.ly/profork | bash</b>

<br>
<br>
<br>
</b>Most of these apps will be available in <i>F1-Applications</i> <br>
as normal desktop apps that stay running in background, so that <br>
you can Alt+Tab between them & use EmulationStation with them running. <br>
Some will also be available in <i>Ports</i> in EmulationStation. <br>
Docker/Podman, and Docker Apps are also available.<br>
There's also a few custom systems available, and a full Arch Container <br>
with Steam/Lutris/Heroic and more. <br>
The full Arch Container applist can be viewed in it's menu:<br>

<i>This is a small hobby repository in no way <br>
shape or form affiliated with the original distro</i><br>
