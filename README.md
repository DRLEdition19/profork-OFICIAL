I was the previous main collaborator of batocera.pro (Cliffy/Trashbus99) with uureel and did development on that repo--especially with the arch container and 
docker scripts.

The current scripts here, that were tested mainly in Dec '24/Jan '25, and that are available in the menu system should be up to date and working as of Jan '25.

Please note, this batocera pro repo fork is mainly for personal use and development; 
use at your own risk. Support is not available. 

Apps (except some containers) will be installed in ```/userdata/system/pro```as before, and your Batocera version will be flagged with a "p" (pro folder) and probably "c" (custom.sh) and possibly "u" (es addon system) if used. 

Please do not ask for support on the Batocera Discord or reddit forums; the moderators are aggressive about denying support if add-ons are 
installed.

Thanks to Uureel for many of the original scripts and Kron4ek for the conty (Arch) container.

Also thanks to IVAN-HC and Srevinsaju for some of the appimage builds.

# How to Remove:  
1. Arch container - Run the uninstaller in the arch menu
2. Standalone Apps - delete the corresponding folder in `/userdata/system/pro` and .sh file in ports folder if applicable. The F1 icon should disappear after rebooting.
3. CasaOS XFCE Debian container - delete the batocera-casaos file and casaos folder in `/userdata/system` and remove launcher editing out from `/userdata/system/custom.sh`
4. Docker apps - just use portainer gui or docker cli to remove individual docker containers or to remove completely: Remove batocera-containers by editing out from custom.sh in `/userdata/system`. Reboot.  Delete the `/userdata/system/batocera-containers` `/userdata/system/container` and `/userdata/system/var/lib/containers` and `conatinerd`.
