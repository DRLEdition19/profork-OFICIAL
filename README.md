I was the previous main collaborator of batocera.pro (Cliffy/Trashbus99) with uureel and did development on that repo--especially with the arch container and 
docker scripts.

The current scripts that were tested mainly in Dec '24/Jan '25 are available in the menu system should be up to date and working as of Jan '25.

Please note, this batocera pro repo fork is mainly for personal use and development; 
use at your own risk. Support is not available. 

Apps will be installed in ```/userdata/system/pro```as before and your Batocera version will be flagged with a "p" and probably "c" and possibly "u" if used. 
Please do not ask for support on the Batocera Discord or reddit forums; the moderators are aggressive about denying support if add-ons are 
installed.
