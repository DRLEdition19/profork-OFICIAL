I was the previous main collaborator of batocera.pro (Cliffy/Trashbus99) with uureel and did development on that repo. 
The current scripts should be up to date and working.

Please note, this batocera pro repo fork is mainly for personal use and development; 
use at your own risk. Support is not available.
