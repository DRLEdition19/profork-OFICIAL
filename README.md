I was the previous main collaborator of batocera.pro (Cliffy/Trashbus99) with uureel and did development on that repo--especially with the arch container and 
docker scripts.

The current scripts here, that were tested mainly in Dec '24/Jan '25--those that are available in the menu system--should be up to date and working as of Jan '25.

# Portmaster 
*(works on x86_64 [AMD/INTEL] and aarch64 [ARM64] like Raspberry Pis )

*(aarch64 has more apps available than x86_64, but are lacking 32-bit app support due to batocera missing 32-bit libs unlike Rocknix, Knulli Firefly, and muOS)

# How to Remove:  
1. Arch container - Run the uninstaller in the arch menu.  Data folders like `/userdata/system/.local/share/Steam` are not deleted and need to be done separately. Their locations vary.
2. Standalone Apps - delete the corresponding folder in `/userdata/system/pro` and .sh file in ports folder if applicable. The F1 icon should disappear after rebooting. App Data folder locations in `/userdata/system` vary.
3. CasaOS XFCE Debian container - delete the batocera-casaos file and casaos folder in `/userdata/system` and remove launcher editing out from `/userdata/system/custom.sh`
4. Docker apps - just use portainer gui or docker cli to remove individual docker containers or to remove completely: Remove batocera-containers by editing out from custom.sh in `/userdata/system`. Reboot.  Delete the `/userdata/system/batocera-containers` `/userdata/system/container` and `/userdata/system/var/lib/containers` and `conatinerd`  Data folders can also be deleted manually like the casaos or umbrel folder in `/userdata/system`.

## 📌 Batocera and Third-Party Add-ons: What You Should Know  

Batocera’s own wiki provides guides on system customization, yet **recent versions now detect and flag users who install third-party add-ons.**  

If you use this repo, **your Batocera version may display additional markers in the version string**:  
- **"P"** – If the `/userdata/system/pro` folder exists (this repo).  
- **"C"** – If `custom.sh` is modified.  
- **"U"** – If third-party EmulationStation add-on custom systems are installed.  
- **"O"** – If the Overlay is modified.  

⚠️ **This may affect support** – Batocera developers have stated they "cannot support modified systems," **even if an issue is unrelated to add-ons.**  

While customization has always been part of open-source philosophy, **users should be aware of these changes in how Batocera handles third-party modifications.**  
This repository is designed to **provide additional functionality for those who wish to expand their system beyond Batocera's default setup.**

## 🤔 Is This Really the Spirit of Open-Source?  

Batocera **claims to support open-source principles, yet actively discourages third-party add-ons.**  
They **provide modding guides in their wiki**, yet **track and penalize users for actually customizing their systems.**  
Issues that **existed long before add-ons** are now **conveniently blamed on third-party modifications.**  

👉 **Batocera’s focus on retro gaming is understandable, and maintaining that vision is their choice.**  
**However, restricting third-party add-ons that enhance the retro gaming experience is not in the spirit of open-source.**  
**True open-source projects allow the community to expand functionality—without arbitrary limitations.**  

💡 **If you experience an issue, consider testing on a clean Batocera install. If the issue persists, it is likely unrelated to add-ons.**

### 🤔 What About Security?  

This repository follows standard open-source principles—**all scripts are fully accessible, modifiable, and auditable by users.**  

- **Transparency:** Every script is available for review before running.  
- **Customization:** Users have full control over modifications to their system.  
- **Fixes:** Some scripts exist to address long-standing Batocera issues that would otherwise remain unresolved.  

While Batocera developers have **expressed concerns about third-party scripts**, open-source software is about **choice, not restriction.**  

If Batocera were truly concerned about security, they would **engage with third-party contributions instead of discouraging all external improvements.**
