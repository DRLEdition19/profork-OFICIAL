I was the previous main collaborator of batocera.pro (Cliffy/Trashbus99) with uureel and did development on that repo--especially with the arch container and 
docker scripts.

The current scripts that were tested mainly in Dec 24/Jan25 are available in the menu system should be up to date and working.

Please note, this batocera pro repo fork is mainly for personal use and development; 
use at your own risk. Support is not available.
