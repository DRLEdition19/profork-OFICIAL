I was the previous main collaborator of batocera.pro (Cliffy/Trashbus99) with uureel and did development on that repo--especially with the arch container and 
docker scripts.

The current scripts here, that were tested mainly in Dec '24/Jan '25, are available in the menu system should be up to date and working as of Jan '25.

Please note, this batocera pro repo fork is mainly for personal use and development; 
use at your own risk. Support is not available. 

Apps (except some containers) will be installed in ```/userdata/system/pro```as before, and your Batocera version will be flagged with a "p" (pro folder) and probably "c" (custom.sh) and possibly "u" (es addon system) if used. 

Please do not ask for support on the Batocera Discord or reddit forums; the moderators are aggressive about denying support if add-ons are 
installed.

Thanks to Uureel for many of the original scripts and Kron4ek for the conty (Arch) container.

Also thanks to IVAN-HC for some of the appimage builds.
